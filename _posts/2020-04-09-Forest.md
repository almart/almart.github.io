# Overview
Forest is an *Easy* rated Windows box and features Active Directory based techniques. This box was released on October 2019 and created by egre55 & mrb3n. It models a poorly configured Domain Controller and a non-traditional technique to attack Kerberos. This is one my favorite boxes from HTB since the enumeration techniques are practical and also serve as good practice for the OSCP.



## Key Takeaways
1. Anonymous access to enumerate domain information
2. AS-REP Roasting technique 
3. Use BloodHound to map out  users, groups, and ACL's
4. Use aclpwn to automate privesc, understand the manual method first
5. Pass the Hash to easily gain access to systems


## Walkthrough 

#### Enumeration:
We start by running a basic port scan for all TCP ports. Immediately, we notice the box resembles a Domain Controller due to DNS, Kerberos, and LDAP being enabled. However, there are no additional interesting services enabled such HTTP, FTP, and Telnet. This generally means we need to leverage Active Directory techniques on the box.

To start, we can enumerate LDAP and SMB for anonymous authentication. 

#### Obstacles Faced:
AS-REP Roasting was a brand new technique for me. I had to get some hints to learn about this method to execute it while the machine was active. Additionally, I researched multiple tools that can perform this attack to keep it in mind for future CTF's and challenges.
