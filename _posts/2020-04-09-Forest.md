# Overview
Forest is an *Easy* rated Windows box and features Active Directory based techniques. This box was released on October 2019 and created by egre55 & mrb3n. This is one my favorite boxes from HTB since the enumeration techniques are both practical and serve good practice for the OSCP. This post also has a video walkthrough (*see below*) which explains some of the attacks and challenges I faced.



# Key Takeaways
1. Anonymous access to enumerate domain information
2. AS-REP Roasting technique 
3. Use *BloodHound* and *aclpwn* for domain dominance 




# Walkthrough 

### Enumeration:
We start by running a basic port scan for all TCP ports. Immediately, we notice the box resembles a Domain Controller due to DNS, Kerberos, and LDAP being enabled. However, there are no additional interesting services enabled such HTTP, FTP, and Telnet. This implies we most likely need to leverage Active Directory techniques on the box.

To start, we can enumerate LDAP and SMB through anonymous authentication. *Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts*. By default, this configuration is disabled by default. When enabled, any user with network access can dump valid domain accounts.

![Anonymous Access](/assets/forest/anonymous.png)

We have a wide range of tools that can enumerate accounts on the target. We are interested in creating a user list is to potentially perform password brute forcing or to query LDAP if a credential was left behind in a data field. I used *rpcclient* and *ridenum* to create a user list.

![Ridenum](/assets/forest/ridenum.png)

This enumeration provides us with two facts. First, we have valid domain accounts and most notably a service account we can target for more information. Second, the box seems have Exchange service enabled due to the HealthMailboxXXXXXXX accounts found. We should keep track of this information as it will probably be needed for privilege escalation. 

### Foothold:

However, we are now presented with our the first challenge. Brute forcing passwords is not viable and plaintext/hashed credentials cannot be found through LDAP. To gain a foothold, we perform a Keberos attack called AS-REP Roasting. An *impacket* script as well as Metasploit module can target the Keberos service and identify any accounts that are AS-REP Roastable. 


![GetNPUsers Description](/assets/forest/getnpuser-desc.png)

While the box was still active, I learned about this technique through the GetNPUsers.py *impacket* script description. A great blog post from [harmj0y](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/roasting-as-reps/) covers the technique in great detail. Any domain account that has the *"Do not require Kerberos preauthentication"* flag enabled can be AS-REP Roasted.

![Pre-auth](/assets/forest/preauth.png)

This configuration effectively removes the Kerberoasting constraint of requiring access to a domain account. Any user on the network can request TGS tickets for those accounts. Thus, we can use our previously enumerated user account to check if this setting is present and request a ticket.

### User Flag:

We now have a TGS for the "svc-alfresco" user and can gather the plaintext credential by using John or Hashcat. I used the *rockyou.txt* wordlist with John to crack the password. From our previous enumeration, we also know the WinRM port 5985 is open. 

![John Cracking](/assets/forest/john-crack.png)

The user has enough privileges to authenticate through WinRM, I used *Evil-WinRM* to create an authenticated session. Furthermore, this account had enough privileges to read the user flag. We have successfully gained a foothold and the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation:

To perform privilege escalation, we start by enumerating the current privileges of the user. We notice the account has membership to interesting groups. Most notably the "Account Operators" group. This is a default security group within Active Directory that is overly privileged. Microsoft even goes as far to state that no users should be granted this right. 

![Permissions](/assets/forest/permissions.png)

![Account Operators](/assets/forest/account-operators-note.png)

This group defeats the goal of implementing the principle of least privilege. It is common to see this misconfiguration in many production environments. The name of the group suggests a much less sinister privilege. This group is used is to attempt to segment IT administrators to perform basic user account changes without domain admin. However, this group can log on to Domain Controllers and add users to other groups. As an attacker, this privilege can easily be abused to gain domain dominance. 

![Add Permissions](/assets/forest/adding-permissions.png)

A naive approach is to simply add ourselves to interesting groups. Unfortunately, we cannot directly add ourselves to Domain Admin. Recall that we enumerated the Exchange services by generating a user list. We can at least add ourselves to the Exchange groups, these privileges are dangerous in the domain. [Dirk-jan](https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/) has more details discussing this vulnerability. An issues arises though, when do we know when to stop and what can now be exploited? Manually enumerating our privileges is expensive in regards to time management. 

 A better approach is to utilize *BloodHound* to graph our privileges, all users, and computers. This tool uses graph theory to layout the domain with nodes and edges. We can query the database to identify potential paths for privilege escalation. Any domain account can use query LDAP for this information. *BloodHound* can be used for offensive and defensive means. 

![BloodHound Ingestor](/assets/forest/bloodhound-gather.png)

We first use a ingestor to collect the data. I like to use the Python version, however, a Powershell equivalent also exists called SharpHound. We can then input the data into the database. *BloodHound* uses *neo4j* to analyze and keep track of the database. 

![Upload Data](/assets/forest/upload-data.png)

![Bloodhound Enum](/assets/forest/bloodhound-check.png)

Now we can query the database and view potential paths to Administrator starting from the svc-alfresco account. Immediately, we notice a path due to adding ourselves to the Exchange Group and inheriting the Account Operators privileges. Notice we have WriteDacl rights to the domain. *BloodHound*  has abuse info for each edge on how to take advantage of this configuration. WriteDacl rights to the domain allows us to perform DCSync and extract NTLM hashes from the NTDS file.

### Obstacles Faced:
AS-REP Roasting was a brand new technique for me. I had to get some hints to learn about this method to execute it while the machine was active.Additionally, I researched multiple tools that can perform this attack to keep it in mind for future CTF's and challenges. 

**Lesson Learn:** Always remember to enumerate the services in front of you fully. It is easy to fall into a rabbit hole if we do not widen our search.
