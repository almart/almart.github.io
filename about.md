## About 
Welcome to my blog! I have been working professionally in infosec for almost two years now. This was created to document and track my journey through information security. I am interested in solving problems related to infosec and mathematics. Examples of posts you will see here are Hackthebox writeups and other challenge I come across. I plan to supplement each write up with a video to discuss obstacles and anything I may have learned.
