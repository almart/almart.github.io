## About
Welcome to my blog! I have been working professionally in Infosec for almost two years now.  This was created to document and track my journey through information security. My primary focus of this blog is to work on solving problems related to Infosec and Mathematics. Examples of posts you will see here are Hackthebox writeups and other challenge I come across. I plan to supplement each write up with a video to discuss obstacles and anything I may have learned.
