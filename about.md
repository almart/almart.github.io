## About
Welcome to my blog! I have been working professionally in Infosec for almost two years now. Specifically, I have experience in penetration testing, security consulting, and IT auditing. This blog was created to document and track my journey. The primary focus of this blog is to work on solving challenging problems related to Infosec and Mathematics. Examples of posts you will see here are Hackthebox writeups and other challenge I come across. I plan to supplement each write up with a video to discuss obstacles and lessons learned.
